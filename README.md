# ðŸ“š Learn Emoji

This repository contains the source code for the website [https://learnemoji.dev](https://learnemoji.dev).

This website is a simple guessing game where an emoji is shown and the user types in a guess.

The answers take the form of canonical short names used on websites such as GitHub, Slack, Discord, Windows, macOS, and more. These short names follow closely to the [CLDR Short Names](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) from [unicode.org](https://unicode.org).

For example, `:see_no_evil:` corresponds to :see_no_evil:, `:hear_no_evil:` is :hear_no_evil:, and `:speak_no_evil:` is :speak_no_evil:.
